	My name is Maged Mahmoud, i am a recent Computer Science graduate from Cuny
  Brooklyn College, with a minor in philosophy. I am trying to self-learn 
  unity and c# as well as javascript and SQL. I work as a swim instructor on my 
  part time as that is my second passion next to Computer science. 
	I am hoping to learn quite a bit about Web design through this short
  prerequisite course. So far it's been great at showing some sources. So i 
  can atleast keep on learning from there.
